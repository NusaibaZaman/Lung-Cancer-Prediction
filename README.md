# Lung-Cancer-Prediction

The following project aims to predict Lung Cancer using the following dataset containing 15 features. This dataset is a classification problem as it’s Label, Lung Cancer is qualitative data that is answered with either a Yes or No. There are 309 data points.
The features in this dataset are Gender, Age, Smoking, Yellow fingers, Anxiety, Peer pressure, Chronic Disease, Fatigue, Allergy, Wheezing, Alcohol Consumption, Coughing, Shortness of breath, Swallowing difficulty and Chest pain. The feature, “Age” is quantitative and the rest are categorical features.

This project uses Machine Learning Models such as Logistic Regression, Neural Networks, KNN and Random Forest to analyze and select the most accurate and precise models with a high recall. The model that produces the most accurate results are Logistic Regression and KNN. In terms of precision, the model KNN has the highest precision and for Recall both Neural Networks and Logistic Regression perform the best. Thus, we can use Logistic Regression or the KNN model to analyze data and predict the likelihood a person has towards Lung Cancer taking into account their lifestyle and attributes.
